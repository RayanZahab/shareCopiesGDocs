# shareCopiesGDocs

You have a class of 50 students.
You create a Google Sheet workbook that you want each student to work on individually. And you do not want them to create a copy of the file, you want to remain the owner of all their workbooks to review and monitor and probably you have protected cells that you dont want them to change.

Instead of creating 50 copies and going to each copy and sharing it with 1 of the students.

This script will allow you from a list of emails to: 
1. Create individual copies of a Google file for each email
2. Rename each copy by the usernme of the email
3. Share each copy with a specific email

All the copies will be made in the same folder as the original file
